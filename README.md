- 👋 Hi, I’m @saramasarone and I'm a Doctoral student at The Alan Turing Institute

- 👀 I’m interested in applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning to multi-omics and biological data to reveal insights in many diseases. Sometimes I also develop packages to automate ML/bioinformatics workflows.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best share the tools I developed :)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical/health projects involing Deep Learning and tabular data

- 📫 You can reach me on my Turing email smasarone@turing.ac.uk (preferred) or at s.masarone@qmul.ac.uk.
