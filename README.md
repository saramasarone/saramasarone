- 👋 Hey, I’m @saramasarone and I'm a Doctoral student at The Alan Turing Institute!

- 👀 I’m interested in applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning to multi-omics and biological data to reveal insights in many diseases. Sometimes I also develop packages to automate ML/bioinformatics workflows.
 
- 🌱 I have developed a few tools to make my PhD life easier :)

- 🏩 I’m looking to collaborate on medical/health projects involing Graph Neural Networks

- 📫 You can email me @ smasarone@turing.ac.uk (preferred) or @ s.masarone@qmul.ac.uk.
